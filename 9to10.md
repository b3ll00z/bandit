``` shell
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit9@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
```
Mmmm..too unreadable bytes! Let's make that clear and select those that starts

``` shell
$ strings data.txt | grep ^=
```
Ok to make it finer we have to consider only the last line and cut first 12
characters.

```shell
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ^= | tail -1 | cut -c 12-
